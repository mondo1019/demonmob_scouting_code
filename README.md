# demonmob_scouting_code
I was bored so I thought I would create a python script to help Runescape demon mob scouters out there. HAPPY SCOUTING!

Just run the code itâ€™s that easy! The code will ask you for the world and location. When finished scouting input 0 for the world option and BLAM it sorts the worlds in alphabetical order. Making scouting and hunting more efficient.
